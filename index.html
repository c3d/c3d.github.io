                    Alpha-Waves was the first 3D platform game ever. I
                    started working on that game in 1988, and it was
                    published by Infogrames in 1990.
                    It was a puzzle/labyrinth game where you jumped
                    from platform to platform to reach doors that
                    would give you access to the next room.
                    It was also in my opinion the first truly immersive 3D
                    game, in the sense that it was the first one to combine
                    true 6-axis 3D, some kind of physics engine, and
                    interaction with a large number of objects.

                  <p>
                    Its genesis, technology, and references to a few games of the
                    same era, are all documented

                    my blog</a>.
                    I published its

                    As an illustration for the capabilities of
                    <a href="#languages-hpds">HPDS</a>, I wrote a few
                    games. The first one was
                    <a href="http://cc3d.free.fr/HPDS3.0/HP48-Sources/PacMan/PacLib.48S" target="_blank">a Pac Man clone</a>, released initially as an assembly-only
                    program with HPDS 1.0, and later converted to an
                    HP-48 library with HPDS 2.0 in 1991. According to
                    <a href="http://www.hp-network.com/~efrei125/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16:interview-de-paul-courbis&catid=7:interview&Itemid=12">Paul Courbis</a>,
                    this was the first game to use the hardware scroll
                    of the HP-48 calculator, making the game very
                    fluid. I don't recall exactly when the game was
                    created, but I would say around 1990, shortly
                    after the introduction of the HP48 (HPDS had been
                    developed earlier, for the HP28).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being one of the very first games for the HP-48,
                    PacMan quickly became very popular, taking advantage
                    of the HP48 built-in infrared networking to spread
                    virally. Hopping from machine to machine, it
                    spread to other countries, including the United
                    States. I received letters from all over the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Various "patches" were made by other programmers, who
                    sometimes added real value like new levels or
                    making it compatible with the HP48GX, but
                    sometimes did little more than put their names in
                    the credits. Various other authors are still
                    incorrectly credited for the game on
                    <a href="http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/games/arcade/">HPCalc.org</a>
                    today.
                    Despite the availability of the

                      source code
                    </a> as part of HPDS, most of these patches were actually made by
                    manipulating the binary, sometimes introducing
                    bugs. Some letters I received complained about
                    bugs that were introduced by these patches.

                    Another demo game for <a href="#languages-hpds">HPDS</a>,
                    also written in 1991, was a small Tetris clone.
                    Like PacMan, this game was intended
                    primarily as a kind of tutorial and demo for what
                    could be done with a cross-development tool for
                    HP48. It was not as successful as PacMan, because
                    there were already dozen of Tetris clones on the
                    HP48 market. I am not positive that the picture
                    here is of my Tetris, it might be another one.

                    As <a href="#languages-hpds">HPDS</a> became more
                    sophisticated, I decided to use it to write more
                    complex HP48 games. Version 3.0 of HPDS included a
                    <a href="http://cc3d.free.fr/HPDS3.0/HP48-Sources/Lemmings/Lemmings%202.48S" target="_blank">clone of Lemmings</a>, complete with an editor to create new
                    levels. This particular source code is dated from
                    1993. It was pushing the limits of the calculator,
                    in particular in terms of memory, but also in the

                    In the years following the release of
                    <a href="#languages-hpds">HPDS</a>, I regularly
                    received letters from people requesting the
                    programs I had written. And then one day, I
                    received a letter asking for my PacMan, my Tetris,
                    my Lemmings and my Space Invaders. So I responded,
                    sending back the first three programs, and
                    explained I had not written a Space Invaders. Then
                    a second letter asking for Space Invaders. Then a
                    third one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I thought little of it, until a friend, who had a
                    large collection of HP48 programs, told me
                      "<em>Your Space Invaders is really not as good
                      as your other games</em>". I replied I had never
                    written a Space Invaders, so he showed it to
                    me. And indeed, someone had written a Space
                    Invaders and put my name in the credits! I'm still
                    hoping that this was a kind of hommage to my
                    other games... I never knew who the
                    real author was.

                    This Breakout is not a true game but a demo for
                    Tao3D. The idea was to create a real game with

                    students the basics of programming. Tao3D makes it

                    Firefly is an work in progress experiment to
                    create a game entirely using ray-marching.
                    Raymarching is a highly detailed rendering
                    technique which can compute realistic shadows or
                    lighting on scenes containing a very large number
                    of visible elements. Raymarching can now be
                    done in real-time, if barely, on a GPU. An
                    interesting idea in Firefly is to compute
                    collisions and physics using the same distance
                    field as for the rendering.

                    My first published program was a BASIC extension for the
                    Sinclair ZX Spectrum, which gave it a range of graphic
                    features such as: windows, ellipses, clipping, flood fill
                    (including with 8x8 patterns)... It was distributed by
                    Valric-Laurene. It was a 3.5KB program written in Z80
                    assembly language.

                    I was unlucky enough to call the program <em>Spectrum+</em>,
                    just one month before Sinclair launched a computer by
                    the same name... In any case, I'm afraid this program
                    was forever lost in the mist of time, like the second
                    program I wrote for Valric-Laurene, a BASIC patch for
                    the French Sinclair QL.

                    SATAS was an assembler for the HP-28C, HP-28S and

                    create any kind of program for the HP calculators,
                    not just assembly-language programs. It was used
                    to create a number of games for these

                    A training period at Alsys SA (Ada compilers) in 1988
                    led me to reflect about what I liked in Ada and what I
                    did not like.  I began laying the foundations of LX,
                    short for <em>langage expérimental</em>
                    (<em>experimental language</em> in French). I
                    worked on LX between 1988 and 1998 without
                    publishing anything or keeping a good track
                    record. I rewrote the compiler from scratch
                    several times as new ideas came up.
                    Earlier LX compilers
                    generated MC68000 assembly language. I later
                    switched to generating C for portability reasons,
                    using <a href="http://mozart-dev.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mozart-dev/mozart/arch/codegen.tbl">
                      code generation tables
                    </a> for configuration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I ultimately published
                    LX as free software
                    <a href="http://mozart-dev.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mozart-dev/mozart/lx/">in early 2000</a>.
                    By that time, LX already had a
                    user-accessible representation for the parse tree
                    and basic garbage collection.
                    Despite never becoming feature complete, it also had
                    some pretty advanced
                    capabilities, like
                    <a href="http://mozart-dev.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mozart-dev/mozart/lx/TESTS/instantiation/">generics</a> (similar to C++
                    templates).

                    In 1998, I joined the Hewlett-Packard Compiler and
                    Languages Lab (CLL) in Cupertino, California, to
                    work on the HP aC++ compiler. I was also supposed
                    to work on my own language, but that quickly
                    tanked, prompting me to go open-source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aC++ code base came from Taligent, and was
                    both advanced in a few aspects, and really
                    backwards in others (one function was 1700 lines
                    of code). On the compiler, I initially worked on
                    templates, performance, the run-time library and
                    precompiled headers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later, I implemented
                    <a href="#systems-eh">exception handling</a>
                    and I was one of the initiators of
                    the <a href="#systems-abi">C++ ABI</a> effort. I also
                    represented HP at the C++ standard committee for a
                    short period. Finally, I built the first native
                    Itanium C and C++ compilers (the HP plan at the
                    time was to run PA-RISC cross compilers in a
                    PA-RISC emulator...). This required coordinating
                    the work of 16 different teams with 16 different
                    ways of writing makefiles...

                    During discussions with other engineers at
                    Hewlett-Packard, we kept talking about a
                    "program database", a way to store all information
                    coming from the front-ends for different
                    languages. The idea was to offer <em>thin tools</em>,
                    small language extensions that would
                    work for all languages, irrespective of their
                    syntax. Use cases included: renaming a function and all
                    calls to it; implementing symbolic
                    differentiation; performing high-level
                    optimizations; etc.

                  <p>
                    I started <a href="http://mozart-dev.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mozart-dev/mozart/">implementing this</a>,
                    initially under the name "Xroma", coined by
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daveed-vandevoorde/4/416/708">Daveed
                    Vandevoorde</a>, and then renamed it Mozart after
                    Daveed left HP and told me he wanted to keep the
                    name Xroma for his own projects. Mozart saw the
                    appearance of the first variant of the "lightbulb" logo.

                    Following a number of very interesting discussions
                    notably with
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daveed-vandevoorde/4/416/708">Daveed Vandevoorde</a>,
                    the focus of LX changed from "experimental" to
                    "extensible". The LX language was renamed XL, and
                    re-implemented on top of
                    <a href="#languages-mozart">Mozart</a> (which, in
                    turn, was largely reusing code from LX).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The XL language inherited advanced generics from
                    LX, but at this point, it was still a language
                    with <a href="http://mozart-dev.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mozart-dev/mozart/xl/xl.tokens">many
                    keywords</a> and a standard syntax-directed parser.

                    Besides <a href="#languages-xl">XL</a>,
                    Moka was the first (and only) language implemented
                    on top of Mozart. It was a relatively complete
                    Java parser. With the help of Moka, it made it
                    possible to implement "thin tools" manipulating
                    Java code, for example to automatically generate
                    boilerplate code, or to perform symbolic
                    differentiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moka quickly demonstrated the limits of the
                    approach in Mozart. The parse tree structure was
                    modelled after the syntax of languages such as
                    Java or C++, so it had dozens of high-level node
                    types, e.g. "IfThenElse" or
                    "FunctionDeclaration". Subtle differences between
                    languages made it very complicated to write a
                    useful plug-in that would actually work with
                    multiple languages.

                    XL2 was also the only implementation of any of my
                    languages where I tried to write the XL2 compiler
                    in XL2, using a three-steps bootstrap.
                    A first stage was written
                    <a href="https://github.com/c3d/XL-programming-language/blob/master/xl2/parser.cpp">in C++</a>, and was used to translate a
                    <a href="https://github.com/c3d/XL-programming-language/tree/master/xl2/bootstrap/xl.parser.xl">"bootstrap"</a>
                    compiler, which itself was used to build the
                    <a href="https://github.com/c3d/XL-programming-language/tree/master/xl2/native/xl.parser.xl">"native"</a>
                    compiler. That final compiler had advanced
                    features like
                    <a href="https://github.com/c3d/XL-programming-language/blob/master/xl2/native/TESTS/10.Generics/minimax_vararg_generic_local_operator.xl">true
                      generic types</a>. It also featured compiler
                      plug-ins to extend the language, for example to
                      implement <a href="https://github.com/c3d/XL-programming-language/blob/master/xl2/native/xl.plugin.differentiation.xl">symbolic

                    ELFE is a very simple and small programming
                    language for everyday programming. While it is a
                    general purpose language, it is specifcally tuned
                    to facilitate the configuration and control of
                    swarms of small devices such as sensors or
                    actuators. It can also be used as a powerful,
                    remotely-accessible extension language for larger
                    applications. ELFE is a trimmed-down version
                    of <a href="#XLR">XL</a> that can run
                    without <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>. It is also
                    the first language I released to incorporate a
                    <a href="https://github.com/c3d/elfe/blob/master/tests/02.Arithmetic/09-complex-arithmetic.elfe">type system</a>
                    I designed in late 2012, based on tree shapes. In
                    many ways, ELFE is the best implementation of XL
                    to date, and is likely to take over.

                  <p>
                    ELFE used to be called ELIoT (Extensible Language
                    for the Internet of Things), but Legrand complained
                    that they own the trademark, so it was renamed.

                    HP ECUTEST was a real-time test system for car
                    electronics, in particular engine control units
                    (ECU). It was capable of generating or monitoring
                    several hundred signals (about 400 in a typical
                    configuration), using a wide variety of
                    analog or digital devices. It featured
                    sub-millisecond closed loop (250us in some
                    configurations) and continuous data logging with
                    multiple time bases, e.g. some based on time, some
                    based on engine rotation.

                  <p>
                    The ECUTEST operating system was doing
                    heterogeneous multiprocessing, combining
                    an x86 Windows PC for command, control and data
                    visualization with several real-time boards (68040
                    running pSOS or PA-RISC with HP-RT). Later systems
                    added a number of VME or VXI devices with their
                    own CPUs (68040 or 68332). The device driver model
                    was distributed, in the sense that configuration
                    was made by the controlling PC, then real-time
                    measurements were done on the 68040/PA-RISC, and
                    then the PC did the actual disk I/O for data
                    logging. ECUTEST also included a hardware-agnostic
                    binary translator, letting customers specify
                    equations that were computed every cycle.

                    Exception handling is a mechanism used in
                    languages such as C++ to deal with run-time
                    errors. Traditional implementations were very
                    hostile to optimizations, which was a real problem
                    for a processor such as Itanium where compiler
                    optimizations were essential for performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brighter minds at Hewlett-Packard had designed an
                    approach which still allowed optimizations. I was
                    tasked with implementing this design in the C++
                    front-end and in the support library. I then
                    documented the way it worked in an article. This approach
                    remains the way exception handling is done
                    in most compilers to date.

                  <p>
                    Following the work on C++ exception handling,
                    I asked Cary Coutant, a brilliant HP engineer who
                    was responsible for the C ABI, if
                    there was a way to make a common ABI for C++ on
                    Itanium. He quickly organized the meetings, and
                    Daveed Vandevoorde and myself began meeting C++
                    engineers from many companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result was a common C++ ABI (application
                    binary interface) explaining how C++ programs must
                    represent data and programs on Itanium
                    computers. But since in practice, this was the
                    first time there was a standard-compliant C++ ABI,
                    this work was soon adopted by compiler vendors for
                    other platforms, starting I believe with GCC,
                    under the impulse of Mark Mitchell who also
                    quickly became the primary maintainer of the ABI
                    documentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So while it is still called the
                    Itanium C++ ABI, in practice, it has been adapted
                    on many platforms, and is still maintained to this
                    day for new revisions of the C++ standard.

                    The HP DE200C was Hewlett-Packard's attempt at
                    entering the market for digital entertainment
                    appliances. It looked and behaved like a CD
                    player, but inside, it was a PC running
                    Linux. It could play CDs, MP3 files, and
                    selected Internet radios through an HP
                    service. It flopped, largely due to the very
                    high price tag. So HP dumped the remaining units
                    for $150 apiece, which was a very good price for
                    a very silent and nice looking, albeit
                    underpowered PC.

                    installed a Gentoo Linux and MythTV and started
                    tinkering. The largest piece of software I wrote
                    was
                    a <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/de200vfd.git">
                      client/server driver for the front panel
                      vacuum flurescent display (VFD)</a>. This design
                    allowed multiple small Linux apps to display in
                    turn on the VFD,
                    including
                    <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/lcdproc-de200c.git">using LCDproc</a>.  I also created
                    a <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-de200c-remote.git">
                      few patches for the Linux kernel
                    </a> to deal with the remote control and
                    front-panel keys (which appeared as some kind of
                    non-standard keyboard).

                    HP Integrity Virtual Machines (HPVM) is a
                    virtualization solution for Itanium-based servers.
                    I started this project in late 2000 and left the team
                    in early 2010, making it the project on which I
                    spent the most time in my professional life. It
                    was also the most complex one, being en
                    enteprise-grade virtualization solution for
                    Itanium processors (not the simplest CPU
                    architecture to virtualize).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this project, I was fortunate to get the early
                    help of two HP system software gurus, Todd Kjos
                    and Jonathan Ross. The three of us got the
                    software to the point of booting 4-way HP-UX guests.
                    Then, we got a much larger team, mostly composed of
                    former Tru64 and OpenVMS wizards who helped us
                    turn this prototype into a real product. The team
                    was constituted of remarkably bright people, some
                    who had been working on operating systems such as
                    TOPS-10, TOPS-20 or OpenVMS long before I even
                    knew what a calculator was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the early design of HPVM, I
                    contributed to many facets of the product:
                    low-level interrupt handlers; binary translation;
                    memory management; interrupt handling; interrupt
                    emulation; context switching; networking and
                    disk I/O; debugging tools; scheduling;
                    scalability; testing; user-space management tools;
                    and I probably forget a few. That was a lot of
                    fun, many interesting problems, and interaction
                    with a number of super-smart people, like Karen Noel,
                    who besides doing most of the work for on-line
                    guest migration, also tried (and failed) to
                    improve my OpenVMS and English skills.

                    HPVM uses HP-UX as its "management console", but
                    also inherited its remarkable I/O capabilities. I
                    called the context switch between the HPVM monitor and HP-UX
                    "transmogrification" (abbreviated Xmog), a reference to
                    <a href="https://disemvowel.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/calvin-and-hobbes-by-bill-watterson-transmogrifier/">Calvin

                    to Bill Watterson.

                  <p>HPVM offered
                    <a href="http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.fr/2008/10/virtual-machines-and-scalability.html">
                      very good scalablity
                    </a> thanks in large part to scheduling work done by
                    Scott Rhine. It also featured high-level management
                    tools, para-virtualized I/Os, on-line guest
                    migration, on-line addition and removal of
                    devices, RAM and even CPUs, cluster integration,
                    and many more things that are just starting to
                    show up in open-source virtualization tools.

                    I feel really bad for not naming all the
                    individuals who contributed to HPVM, but they know
                    who they are, and they know I remember them all fondly.

                    µSolver was the first graphical application I
                    wrote for the Atari ST probably in 1986-1987.
                    It was essentially a clone
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK_Solver">TK!Solver</a>,
                    a tool to solve multiple non-linear equations. I
                    had created it mostly as a way to validate that I
                    had figured out how TK!Solver worked.
                    Compared to TK!Solver, µSolver added complex
                    numbers and more advanced graphing capabilities.
                    And of course, it ran on the less expensive Atari
                    ST instead of the Mac.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    µSolver was written in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFA_BASIC">GFA
                      Basic</a>, a structured variant of BASIC.
                    It worked well in interpreted mode, but the GFA
                    BASIC compiler was buggy, and I could never
                    produce a stable compiled version. That obviously
                    prevented me from ever turning it into a
                    commercial product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One day, I showed µSolver to an older student. I
                    was very proud of having invented a way to
                    solve multiple non-linear equations. Then the
                    student said something like "Oh, I see, you used
                    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_Raphson">Newton-Raphson</a>
                    algorithm". I was really bummed my algorithm, which I
                    thought was really cool, had actually been
                    described centuries earlier by Newton.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I still have a floppy which theoretically has µSolver
                    on it, but no drive or machine to read it, and I don't
                    know the chances to read a disk that is 25 years
                    old. So I guess it's been lost.

                    CapaVoit (Capacité de Voitures) was my first Mac
                    application. I created it while working for
                    <a href="http://axlog.fr">Axlog Ingénierie</a>
                    in Paris. It was a tool designed to help design
                    cars for subway trains, with a particular focus on
                    capacity planning and rapid prototyping.

                  <p>
                    In practice, CapaVoit was basically a MacDraw
                    clone with a built-in numerical solver similar to
                    that in µSolver, enhanced to deal with
                    inequations. The first release was not very
                    successful with the customer, because very often,
                    the solver would override what had been drawn with
                    a perfectly acceptable solution containing mostly
                    zeroes. Release 1.5 fixed this issue and addressed
                    many other customer feedbacks.

                    I am an avid Emacs user. So when Apple released
                    OSX with a text-only version of Emacs (one that
                    worked only in the Terminal app), I was
                    disappointed. I waited a couple of months,
                    thinking that someone else would fix this. But it
                    did not happen. So I took an old NeXT port,
                    adapted it to the Aqua graphical interface, added
                    a few OSX-only niceties like transparent windows,
                    and published it on SourceForge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This port is now obsolete. By the time Emacs 23
                    was out, there were several forks and
                    alternative implementations, and soon, maintaining
                    a separate branch of Emacs became unnecessary,
                    since the primary version had integrated native
                    graphical support for MacOSX.

                    Make-It-Quick is a simple build system destined to
                    make it easy to build C or C++ programs without
                    having to write lengthy makefiles or going through
                    the complexity of tools such as automake or
                    cmake. It is well suited for relatively small
                    programs, although it has been used for at least
                    one much larger program.

                    The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/theory-incomplete-measurements-Towards-unified-dp-B09TMN922M/dp/B09TMN922M">theory
                    of incomplete measurements</a> proposes a long-sought and
                    improbable solution to the problem of unifying quantum
                    mechanics and general relativity. It starts with a new
                    principle of relativity, suggesting that we should be able
                    to do physics using any instrument, including a broken
                    voltmeter or watching through foggy glasses.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This requires a precise definition of physical measurements.
                    We must learn a new way to do physics, without equations or
                    real numbers. In this new vision of the universe, there is
                    no continuum, no space and no time, but only discrete
                    measurements of space and time which are not all equivalent
                    to one another. We also need new changes of reference frame,
                    that can correctly deal with non-linear or irreversible
                    conversions from one physical instrument to another.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The good news is that we have all the discrete mathematics
                    we need. We use it every time we take a snapshot with a
                    digital camera. We just did not realize that a digital
                    picture records the probability of detecting photons, and
                    predicts the probability for a screen to emit them. In other
                    words, it is the functional equivalent of a wave function,
                    but in discrete form, which we can call
                    a <em>probavector</em>.

                    The standard way to teach special relativity still
                    uses the Lorenz and Einstein formalism as written
                    in 1905. For example, relativity teaches us that
                    if two spaceships cross at high speed, each will
                    see clocks in the other spaceship beating slower
                    than its own clocks. In high school, I found that
                    shocking, since if A was smaller than B, then B
                    could not also be smaller than A. But the best
                    answer my physics teacher could give me was:
                    "<em>That's what the computation says</em>". That
                    answer did not satisfy me at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So I kept working on special relativity until I
                    finally got it. And I finally understood that
                    special relativity is just the regular laws of
                    perspective, but in a space-time where you need to
                    put a minus side in the Pythagorean theorem. To
                    me, that was like a revelation, and I needed to
                    share it with the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It did not make much of a difference. Most
                    people who really know relativity also know that
                    Lorenz transform is a rotation (called
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick_rotation">
                      Wick rotation</a>). And yet, they still use Einstein's
                    formulas to teach, which totally obfuscates the
                    physical meaning, leaving non-scientists dubious
                    at best, and preventing students to use their
                    intution to verify their equations.

                    There once was a time when cell phone ring tones
                    had to be monophonic. Two notes were one too
                    many. So I tried to create a monophonic ring tone
                    that would not be too boring. I still use it to
                    that day. I named it <em>Trop de Notes</em> (Too
                    many notes) in reference to this
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_UsmvtyxEI"
                       target="_blank">wonderful scene in Amadeus</a>.
                    I also thought of a passage in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cloud">The
                    Black Cloud</a> where the Cloud asks for some
                    music to be played back too fast.

                  <p>
                    I created a few other pieces of music which
                    are also mostly crap. Oh well, I'm better at computers
                    than music. But at least, my ringtone is my own

                    <em>Someone Else's Problem</em> is a daily
                    webcomic that I started in late May 2018.  Its tag
                    line: "<em>Almost, but not quite, entirely unlike
                    answers to Life, the Universe and
                    Everything.</em>".

                  <p>
                    As the title and tag line may suggest, I am very fond
                    of Douglas Adam's humorous thinking. I also get my
                    inspiration from masters such as Marcel Gotlib,
                    André Franquin, Bill Watterson or, in a different
                    style, Randall Munroe. But there will be tribute
                    to many other thinkers I like along the way. More
                    generally, this webcomic is about how strange and
                    amazing our universe and our minds are.

                    3DIVART is my attempt to adapt ray-tracing and
                    ray-marching shaders from locations such as
                    <a href="http://www.shadertoy.org">ShaderToy</a>
                    for use on auto-stereoscopic screens using
                    Tao3D. As a result, I get 3D interactive visual
                    art, i.e. something that you see in 3D, but that
                    is perfectly synthetic.

                    Most of the 3DIVART pieces I created that way are
                    obviously derived from work on ShaderToy. But I
                    also started creating a few pieces of my own.

                    I finished it after 32 years, and published it.
                    It is a humorous science-fiction auto-biography by
                    Antoine Ravelin, which explains how a video game
                    saves humanity with the help of dinosaurs. It features

                    that can tell you if the woman of your life is a

                    a chlorophyl-based Internet where spam occupies the
                    vast majority of Canada's forests. This kind of things

                    I started the Grenouille Bouillie blog ("Boiled Frog"
                    in French) in 2003, after returning from
                    California. I wanted to describe this
                    peculiar syndrom of people who lived in multiple
                    countries. They no longer take for granted what
                    they used to accept. For example, French people
                    take it for granted that service in a supermarket
                    has to be terrible, while many US inhabitants take
                    it for granted that cheese has to be processed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over time, the blog evolved to cover all these
                    things that we come to accept little by little,
                    like software bugs or stupid politicians.

                    while. I later revived it to focus specifically on
                    a satire of French politics, often in French
                    only. You may find it funny. Or not (especially if
                    you are not French and don't know anything about
                    the jokers I keep talking about). And sometimes
                    I'm a bit more serious on things I feel are important.

                    I was one of the founders of Taodyne in 2011. I am
                    still the most frequent author on the company blog.
                    I write tutorials and use cases for Tao3D, as well
                    as general news about the company and,
                    occasionally, the industry. Unfortunately, this
                    blog was lost when Gandi pulled the plug on their
                    US data center (I was too much under water at the
                    time to take the couple of days it would have
                    taken to migrate the data).

                    There is also an

                    on Blogspot which is no longer maintained.

                    I joined Red Hat in January 2017. It's good to
                    finally be able to do things I love in the open
                    and get paid for it. My focus is primarily on
                    virtualization and 3D, so two of my primary
                    centers of interest converge. I'm part of the
                    Spice team, since remote visualization is essential
                    to the virtualization offering of Red
                    Hat. Although at the moment I still know very
                    little about Spice, to be honest.

                    I started maintaing a daily blog of things I want to
                    remember. Since that blog is really for myself, I
                    don't care if things are hard to understand or
                    follow my own internal logic.  Don't expect
                    literature there. It's really more like a kind of
                    public lab book.

                    In case you wonder, Red Skin Cat in french
                    translates as "Chat Peau Rouge", which pronounces
                    the same as french "Chapeau Rouge", or "Red Hat".
